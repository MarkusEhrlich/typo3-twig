Installation
============

This extension only works when installed in composer mode.
If you are not familiar using composer together with TYPO3 yet,
you can find a `how to on the TYPO3 website <https://composer.typo3.org/>`__.

Install the extension with the following command:

.. code:: bash

    composer require cvc/typo3-twig
